A is guilty of murder, although he may not have had a premeditated design to kill any particular individual.Exception 1When culpable homicide is not murder ì Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, whilst deprived of the power of self-control by grave and sudden provocation, causes the death of the person who gave the provocation or causes the death of any other person by mistake or accident.The above exception is subject to the following provisos:ProvisosThat the provocation is not sought or voluntarily provoked by the offender as an excuse for killing or doing harm to any person.That the provocation is not given by anything done in obedience to the law, or by a public servant in the lawful exercise of the powers of such public servant.That the provocation is not given by anything done in the lawful exercise of the right of private defence.ExplanationsWhether the provocation was grave and sudden enough to prevent the offence from amounting to murder is a question of fact.IllustrationsA, under the influence of passion excited by a provocation given by Z, intentionally kills Y, Zô child. This is murder, inasmuch as the provocation was not given by the child, and the death of the child was not caused by accident or misfortune in doing an act caused by the provocation.Y gives grave and sudden provocation to A. A, on this provocation, fires a pistol at Y, neither intending nor knowing himself to be likely to kill Z, who is near him, but out of sight. A kills Z. Here A has not committed murder, but merely culpable homicide.A is lawfully arrested by Z, a bailiff. A is excited to sudden and violent passion by the arrest, and kills Z. This is murder, inasmuch as the provocation was given by a thing done by a public servant in the exercise of his powers.A appears as a witness before Z, a Magistrate. Z says that he does not believe a word of Aô deposition, and that A has perjured himself. A is moved to sudden passion by these words, and kills Z. This is murder.A attempts to pull Zô nose. Z, in the exercise of the right of private defence, lays hold of A to prevent him from doing so. A is moved to sudden and violent passion in consequence, and kills Z. This is murder, inasmuch as the provocation was giving by a thing done in the exercise of the right of private defence.Z strikes B. B is by this provocation excited to violent rage. A, a bystander, intending to take advantage of Bô rage, and to cause him to kill Z, puts a knife into Bô hand for that purpose. B kills Z with the knife. Here B may have committed only culpable homicide, but A is guilty of murder.Exception 2Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender in the exercise in good faith of the right of private defence or person or property, exceeds the power given to him by law and causes the death of the person against whom he is exercising such right of defence without premeditation, and without any intention of doing more harm than is necessary for the purpose of such defence.IllustrationsZ attempts to horsewhip A, not in such a manner as to cause grievous hurt to A. A draws out a pistol. Z persists in the assault. A believing in good faith that he can by no other means prevent himself from being horsewhipped, shoots Z dead. A has not committed murder, but only culpable homicide.Exception 3Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, being a public servant or aiding a public servant acting for the advancement of public justice, exceeds the powers given to him by law, and causes death by doing an act which he, in good faith, believes to be lawful and necessary for the due discharge of his duty as such public servant and without ill-will towards the person whose death is caused.Exception 4Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without premeditation in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel and without the offenderô having taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner.ExplanationsIt is immaterial in such cases which party offers the provocation or commits the first assault.Exception 5Culpable homicide is not murder when the person whose death is caused, being above the age of eighteen years, suffers death or takes the risk of death with his own consent.IllustrationsA, by instigation, voluntarily causes Z, a person under eighteen years of age, to commit suicide. Here, on account of Zô youth, he was incapable of giving consent to his own death; A has therefore abetted murder."

17,Offences Against Property,378,Theft,"Whoever, intending to take dishonestly any movable property out of the possession of any person without that personô consent, moves that property in order to such taking, is said to commit theft.ExplanationsA thing so long as it is attached to the earth, not being movable property, is not the subject of theft; but it becomes capable of being the subject of theft as soon as it is severed from the earth.A moving effected by the same act which effects the severance may be a theft.A person is said to cause a thing to move by removing an obstacle which prevented it from moving or by separating it from any other thing, as well as by actually moving it.A person, who by any means causes an animal to move, is said to move that animal, and to move everything which, in consequence of the motion so caused, is moved by that animal.The consent mentioned in the definition may be express or implied, and may be given either by the person in possession, or by any person having for that purpose authority either express or implied.IllustrationsA cuts down a tree on Zô ground, with the intention of dishonestly taking the tree out of Zô possession without Zô consent. Here, as soon as A has severed the tree in order to such taking, he has committed theft.A puts a bait for dogs in his pocket, and thus induces Zô dog to follow it. Here, if Aô intention be dishonestly to take the dog out of Zô possession without Zô consent, A has committed theft as soon as Zô dog has begun to follow A.A meets a bullock carrying a box of treasure. He drives the bullock in a certain direction, in order that he may dishonestly take the treasure. As soon as the bullock begins to move, A has committed theft of the treasure.A being Zô servant, and entrusted by Z with the care of Zô plate, dishonestly runs away with the plate, without Zô consent. A has committed theft.Z, going on a journey, entrusts his plate to A, the keeper of a warehouse, till Z shall return. A carries the plate to a goldsmith and sells it. Here the plate was not in Zô possession. It could not therefore be taken out of Zô possession, and A has not committed theft, though he may have committed criminal breach of trust.A finds a ring belonging to Z on a table in the house which Z occupies. Here the ring is in Zô possession, and if A dishonestly removes it, A commits theft.A finds a ring lying on the high-road, not in the possession of any person. A, by taking it, commits no theft, though he may commit criminal misappropriation of property.A sees a ring belonging to Z lying on a table in Zô house. Not venturing to misappropriate the ring immediately for fear of search and detection, A hides the ring in a place where it is highly improbable that it will ever be found by Z, with the intention of taking the ring from the hiding place and selling it when the loss is forgotten. Here A, at the time of first moving the ring, commits theft.A delivers his watch to Z, a jeweller, to be regulated. Z carries it to his shop. A, not owing to the jeweller any debt for which the jeweller might lawfully detain the watch as a security, enters the shop openly, takes his watch by force out of Zô hand, and carries it away. Here A, though he may have committed criminal trespass and assault, has not committed theft, inasmuch as what he did was not done dishonestly.If A owes money to Z for repairing the watch, and if Z retains the watch lawfully as a security for the debt, and A takes the watch out of Zô possession, with the intention of depriving Z of the property as a security for his debt, he commits theft, inasmuch as he takes it dishonestly.Again, if A, having pawned his watch to Z, takes it out of Zô possession without Zô consent, not having paid what he borrowed on the watch, he commits theft, though the watch is his own property inasmuch as he takes it dishonestly.A takes an article belonging to Z out of Zô possession without Zô consent, with the intention of keeping it until he obtains money from Z as a reward for its restoration. Here A takes dishonestly; A has therefor committed theft.A being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Zô library in Zô absence, and takes away a book without Zô express consent for the purpose merely of reading it, and with the intention of returning it. Here, it is probable that A may have conceived that he had Zô implied consent to use Zô book. If this was Aô impression, A has not committed theft.A asks charity from Zô wife. She gives A money, food and clothes, which A knows to belong to Z her husband. Here it is probable that A may conceive that Zô wife is authorized to give away alms. If this was Aô impression, A has not committed theft.A is the paramour of Zô wife. She gives a valuable property, which A knows to belong to her husband Z, and to be such property as she has not authority from Z to give. If A takes the property dishonestly, he commits theft.A, in good faith, believing property belonging to Z to be Aô own property, takes that property out of Bô possession. Here, as A does not take dishonestly, he does not commit theft."
