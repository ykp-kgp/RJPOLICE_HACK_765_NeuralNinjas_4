## 📝 Setting Up the Server

Ensure you have **Node.js** installed before proceeding.

### 🚀 Steps to Run the Server on LocalHost:

1. **Navigate to Your Local Directory:**  
   Open your terminal and change the directory to where you want to set up the server.
   
2. **Initialize a New Node.js Project:**  
   This will create a package.json with default settings.
   ```bash
   npm init -y
   

3. **Install Express:**
   Express is a fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
   ```bash
   npm install express

4. **Install CORS:**
   CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a security feature that controls access to resources on a web page from other domains.
   ```
   npm install cors

5. **Run Your Node Application:**
   To start your server, execute:
   ```
   node app.js
